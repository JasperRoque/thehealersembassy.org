1. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser to view the website.
2. Replace the placeholder images in the `images` folder with actual images.
3. Update the contact information and about section with real information.
4. For a live website, you would need to implement server-side functionality for the contact form.

- Content: Modify the text in `index.html`
- Images: Replace placeholder images with real ones
- Functionality: Extend the JavaScript in `script.js`

## Notes

- For the contact form to work, you'll need to implement server-side processing.
- The astrology map is currently a placeholder and should be replaced with an actual business astrology chart or visualization.
